## Overview of the European Schools

- introduction
- system overview
- founded
- establishment

The European Schools are public, intergovernmental educational establishments jointly managed by the governments of EU Member States and European Union institutions. The first European School was founded in Luxembourg in 1953, originally to educate the children of EU staff.

Today, the system has evolved into a model of educational excellence accessible to a broader community of learners across Europe. Since 2005, the network has expanded to include Accredited European Schools—national schools (public or private) authorised to offer the European Schools' curriculum and the European Baccalaureate Diploma.

What makes these schools truly unique is their commitment to multilingualism and multiculturalism. Pupils learn alongside classmates from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, studying in multiple European languages. The curriculum integrates the best pedagogical practices from EU Member States whilst nurturing linguistic and cultural diversity. Education is provided from nursery through primary to secondary cycle, culminating in the prestigious European Baccalaureate Diploma, which is officially recognised as an entry qualification for higher education in all EU Member States and beyond.

The European Schools embody core European values including human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, rule of law, respect for human rights, inclusiveness, equity, and sustainability. These principles, outlined in the Convention defining the Statute of the European Schools, ensure that pupils develop not only academically but also as responsible European and global citizens.

- core principles

The European Schools' mission is to provide high-quality, multilingual, multicultural, and inclusive education rooted in European and democratic values. The system fosters citizenship, intercultural understanding, and cooperation, equipping pupils with the competencies necessary to thrive academically, socially, and personally in a diverse and rapidly changing globalised world.

Four core values underpin everything the European Schools do:

**European Identity**: The schools integrate the European dimension throughout their pedagogy whilst upholding European values such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, and sustainability. Pupils develop a strong sense of European citizenship whilst maintaining their national identity and cultural heritage.

**Multilingualism and Multiculturalism**: Education is provided in all official languages of the EU from nursery to upper-secondary level. The schools are committed to upholding and preserving national languages and cultures whilst providing a multicultural education through the curriculum. Pupils study at least two and up to four foreign languages during their education.

**Collaboration**: Pupils from different language sections study certain subjects together in mixed language groups. Teachers from across EU Member States collaborate in teaching, sharing, and exchanging best practice. Inspectors from all Member States work together to provide professional advice on pedagogical developments and collaborate in decision-making processes. The schools also promote active participation of all stakeholders—including pupils, parents, educators, and administrative staff—in decision-making.

**Inclusion**: The European Schools provide learning opportunities to enable all pupils to reach their full potential, regardless of their background, identity, or ability. Supporting the wellbeing of pupils and staff is a fundamental priority across all schools.

- pedagogy

The European Schools offer a truly distinctive educational experience that sets them apart from traditional national school systems.

**Language Learning Structure**: The well-designed language teaching structure ensures pupils develop strong multilingual competencies. Pupils are instructed through and learn in their dominant language (L1), which fosters their cultural identity. From the beginning of primary cycle, pupils study a second language (L2). A compulsory third language (L3) begins at the start of secondary cycle, with options for two additional foreign languages (L4/L5) during the secondary years.

**Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)**: A unique feature of the European Schools is the CLIL methodology, where certain subjects are taught in the pupil's second language. This approach is introduced in the final years of primary cycle and developed systematically throughout secondary education. Subjects such as European Hours (in primary), Human Sciences, Geography, History, Economics, and Religion/Ethics are taught using CLIL, enabling pupils to become fluent in multiple languages whilst mastering academic content.

**Educational Objectives**: The curriculum focuses on developing pupils' knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes embedded in the key competencies for lifelong learning. Pupils are challenged to become creative, collaborative, and critical thinkers, as well as responsible European and global citizens. The schools foster responsibility, communication, cooperation, tolerance, and concern for others, with special attention to mental health and psychological wellbeing.

**Comprehensive Education**: The system provides a complete educational pathway from nursery through primary to secondary cycle. At the end of year 5 of secondary cycle, all pupils receive a Junior Laureate Certificate before progressing to the final two years that culminate in the European Baccalaureate.

The European Schools create a dynamic learning environment where pupils from different backgrounds learn together, preparing them for life in an interconnected Europe and beyond.

The European Baccalaureate is a prestigious and rigorous diploma that has been awarded since 1959. It represents the culmination of a pupil's education in the European Schools system.

**Eligibility and Requirements**: Pupils who complete at least the two final years of secondary education (years 6 and 7) in a European School have the opportunity to be awarded the European Baccalaureate Diploma. This diploma certifies that graduates can communicate fluently in at least two languages (Language 1 and Language 2) and have studied a wide range of subjects.

**Assessment**: Pupils are assessed through both written and oral examinations, demonstrating their competence across multiple disciplines. The rigorous examination process ensures that the diploma maintains its high academic standards and international recognition.

**Recognition**: The European Baccalaureate Diploma is officially recognised as an entry qualification for higher and further education in all EU Member States, as well as in numerous other countries worldwide. This recognition is guaranteed by Article 5 of the Convention defining the statute of the European Schools. Graduates can pursue university studies across Europe and beyond without additional entrance examinations in most cases.

**Quality Assurance**: The quality assurance of the European Baccalaureate is overseen by an independent Chairperson of the European Baccalaureate, supported by Inspectors delegated to the European Schools by each Member State. This robust quality assurance process ensures that the diploma maintains its reputation for academic excellence.

The European Baccalaureate is widely recognised for its academic depth and breadth, and graduates are well-prepared for the challenges of higher education and professional life. The diploma reflects not only academic achievement but also the multilingual, multicultural competencies that define the European Schools experience.

The European Schools have an ambitious vision for the future, committed to empowering pupils through high-quality education that nurtures curiosity, creativity, critical thinking, adaptability, and a lifelong passion for learning.

**Adaptive and innovative learners**: The schools recognise that pupils need to become increasingly resilient, innovative, responsible, and independent learners. In addition to academic subjects and key competencies for lifelong learning, pupils will develop flexible soft skills and transformative competencies. These include critical thinking, effective communication and collaboration, curiosity, creativity, and experiential inquiry-based learning approaches. Graduates will be self-aware lifelong learners with strong multicultural backgrounds, multilingual skills, and literacy across communication, humanities, mathematics, science, digital technologies, and social skills.

**Curriculum and pedagogy**: A flexible and evolving curriculum will equip pupils with both academic and practical skills required for their future. Social-emotional learning and wellbeing will be integrated into teaching practices and daily school culture. The European identity will continue to guide curriculum development whilst also fostering national identity, heritage, and culture. Teachers will employ cross-curricular approaches and embed European values in every learning context.

**Sustainability and democratic values**: The schools aim to empower pupils as agents of change in an increasingly unstable world, helping build a more sustainable Europe committed to democratic values. A whole-school approach will incorporate sustainability into all areas of activity, making it part of the lived and taught experience. Pupils will engage actively with their wider school community on sustainability matters.

**Technology and innovation**: Technology will be extensively employed, including e-assessment tools, high-performing learning management systems, and open educational resources. These digital tools will support personalised educational experiences whilst ensuring that human values, skills, and the human dimension remain at the heart of education. Teachers will act as facilitators of learning, implementing collaborative teaching practices with active pupil involvement.

**Inclusion and wellbeing**: The schools envision a vibrant, inclusive educational community where diversity is a cornerstone of learning and growth. Flexible and adaptive policies will reflect the diverse needs and aspirations of school communities, promoting universal access to high-quality education. Pupils will learn in a safeguarded environment that promotes wellbeing, respect, and inclusion. Recognising the intrinsic link between holistic wellbeing and learning, social and emotional development will remain a key priority.

## Role in European Education
- european education
- cooperation
- partnership
- visibility
- influence
- professional development
- accredited schools
- expansion
- collaboration
- policymakers

The European Schools system is regarded as a high-quality educational model in the European Union, offering a unique blend of national and European educational elements that ensure both excellence and inclusivity.

**A centre for dialogue**: The system aspires to become a centre for dynamic dialogue with other educators and policymakers. Through the exchange of innovative, evidence-informed, and value-driven practices, the schools aim to adapt to evolving societal needs, remain resilient when faced with challenges, and continuously strengthen internal capacity through quality assurance mechanisms.

**Expanding presence and visibility**: The European Schools aim to increase visibility and influence in the field of education within the EU. Participation in educational debates with various Member States and key stakeholders in education policymaking will be strengthened. The system seeks to promote this unique educational model throughout the EU and expand its presence across all Member States, with the possibility of establishing Accredited European Schools in additional countries depending on interest and priorities.

**Sharing resources and practices**: The European Schools provide pupils with access to a multilingual, comprehensive, competence-based, value-driven curriculum that continues to evolve and can be adapted to national education systems. Teaching and learning materials are being developed and shared through cooperation with national education systems.

**New forms of cooperation**: The system will explore new forms of cooperation and partnerships with national and international organisations. Cooperation between European Schools and other national educational institutions will be strengthened, potentially drawing on national networks of schools abroad established by various EU Member States. The use of online courses, virtual classrooms, and blended e-learning models will be explored to make European schooling more accessible, especially for pupils in remote areas or vulnerable communities.

**International cooperation**: The European Schools can play a key role in promoting international cooperation beyond EU borders. Bringing European schooling closer to neighbouring and strategic partner countries could create opportunities for pupils and educators from outside Europe to engage with the European Schools' model, fostering mutual understanding and educating future leaders who share and uphold European ideals.

**Professional development**: The schools are developing continuous professional development pathways where best practices and innovative educational experiences can be shared and exchanged with other schools across Europe. Enhanced external collaboration through participation in European mobility and cooperation programmes, alongside dialogue with academia to validate teaching practice through research, will support this mission.
