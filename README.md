**Prompt Template:**

I need you to create an interactive chatbot in Markdown format based on the example structure provided. 

**Your task:**
1. Analyse the example.md file to understand the chatbot format and syntax
2. Extract the key themes, topics, and information from the content document provided
3. Structure the content into an engaging, navigable chatbot

**Requirements:**
- Include YAML frontmatter (clavier: true, gestionGrosMots: true, rechercheContenu: false)
- Write an engaging initial message that introduces the topic and guides users with 3-5 navigation options
- Create 4-7 level 2 sections (##) covering the main themes from the content
- Each section should include:
  - A list of trigger keywords/phrases (in a bullet list at the top)
  - Clear, accessible explanations in 2-4 paragraphs
  - 2-3 navigation links at the end connecting to related sections
- Use descriptive link text for buttons: [Button text](Section heading)
- Include an option to return to the start where appropriate: [Back to start]()
- Make the content educational but engaging, breaking complex ideas into digestible chunks
- Ensure logical flow between sections so users can explore topics in different orders

**Tone:** Informative, accessible, and encouraging exploration

Please create the chatbot and save it as a .md file.
