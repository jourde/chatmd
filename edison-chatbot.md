# Edison and Educational Technology

Welcome! This chatbot explores Thomas Edison's views on educational technology and what we can learn from his predictions about the future of learning.

In 1913, Edison famously predicted that "books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye." He believed that motion pictures would revolutionise education, claiming they were far more efficient than traditional textbooks.

But was he right? And what can his predictions teach us about educational technology today?

## Edison's educational background
- childhood
- schooling
- Port Huron
- addled mind
- sensorimotor learning

Thomas Edison had a difficult experience as an eight-year-old pupil in Reverend Engle's single-room school in Port Huron. He didn't feel that he fitted in, and even overheard the schoolmaster say that his mind was "addled". 

Unsurprisingly, Edison developed a profound distaste for the schooling he had received. Instead of rote learning, he preferred to observe with his own eyes, make things with his own hands, and do things by himself. Learning was for him a sensorimotor experience—something he experienced through his senses and physical actions.

This childhood experience profoundly shaped his later views on education and influenced his belief that traditional schooling needed to be revolutionised.

## Edison's predictions
- movies in schools
- motion pictures
- educational films
- books obsolete
- visual learning
- 85 percent

In 1913, Edison made bold predictions about the future of education. He claimed that within ten years, "books will soon be obsolete in the public schools. Scholars will be instructed through the eye."

Edison believed that movies were better suited than books to bring to life historical events like the American Revolution, convey the workings and beauty of crystals, and reveal the microscopic life of ponds. He argued that movies make "the scientific truths, difficult to understand from textbooks, plain and clear to children."

To support his claims, he used what appeared to be scientific data—though with questionable validity. He claimed that "85 percent of all knowledge is received through the eyes and that motion pictures are 100 percent efficient for its dissemination," compared to a mere two percent efficiency provided by schoolbooks.

## The reality of Edison's predictions
- books not obsolete
- technology hype
- cautionary tale
- prediction failures
- laptops
- MOOCs

Edison's prediction that books would be obsolete within ten years clearly didn't come true. Many commentators use this quote as a cautionary tale to confidently predict that technology, although repeatedly hailed as a soon-to-be disrupter of education, is not the future of education.

They point to similar patterns throughout history: laptops did not overtake classrooms in the 1990s, and massive open online courses (MOOCs) did not disrupt universities in the 2010s, contrary to predictions at the time.

However, this interpretation misses the mark. Whilst books haven't become obsolete, multimedia, computers, and MOOC-like material are indeed playing a significant role in educational settings today. Each represents an impactful new addition to the arsenal of helpful learning materials and methodologies.

The truth is more nuanced than simply "Edison was wrong."

## Edison the salesman
- hyperbole
- businessman
- phonograph predictions
- used car salesman
- marketing

Edison often displayed a "used car salesman" attitude—after all, he was just as much a businessman as an inventor trying to boost sales for his inventions.

His tendency for hyperbolic rhetoric wasn't limited to educational films. In 1877, when he invented the phonograph, he enthusiastically 'predicted' that his invention would lead to radical changes: "the lecturer will no longer require his audience to meet him in a public hall, but will sell his lectures in quart bottle, at fifty cents each."

In a rather fanciful way, he even declared that pupils in future wouldn't need to learn their letters or wrestle with spelling books, as the phonograph would do it all for them.

Such statements from Edison were rarely taken seriously by educators at the time, so invoking them as evidence that all educational technology is overhyped could be something of a straw man argument.

## Lessons for modern education
- pedagogical principles
- avoid hype
- technology adoption
- critical thinking
- productive approach
- shiny gadgetry

It's not interesting nor fruitful to presume that all new educational technology is hyped and deterministically leads to a "trough of disillusionment," proving it has little to no impact on education.

A more productive approach is to separate the embellishments from the nuggets of truth. Although few would expect a technotopian takeover, it is reasonable to expect that innovative technology will continue to be instrumental in shaping the future of education.

The critical question is to understand which technologies we should embrace and promote in an educational context and which are likely to be successful in the future, whilst avoiding shiny new gadgetry.

To do this successfully, we must ensure that technology adoption is rooted in pedagogical principles—not just marketing hype or the latest trends. The goal should always be to enhance learning outcomes for pupils, not simply to implement technology for technology's sake.
