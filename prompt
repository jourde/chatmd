# Chatbot title

Initial message that appears when the chatbot is launched.
At the end of the message, it is recommended to guide the user towards possible choices

1. [How to guide the user](Guiding the user)

## Guide the user

You can guide the user by leaving options at the end of the response (and only at the end).

We make an ordered list (a number then a dot, then a space) and we write a link in each item with the option title (which appears in a clickable button) and the title of the option, which must correspond to one of the level 2 titles (you put whatever you want here: the user doesn't see it unless he hovers over the button with his mouse).

If you want to return to the initial message, leave the link empty.

1. [First choice](option 1)
2. [Second choice](Option 2)
3. [Return to initial message]()

## option 1
- great
- super
- absolutely fantastic

This is the first option.
This option will appear if you click on the "First choice" button above.
But we've also included additional triggers (keywords or expressions), and if you type these expressions or something similar to them in the chatbot's text box, it will send you to this option.
The title of the option is also considered to be the first possible trigger.

## Option 2
Here's the second option.
If I had put a lower case letter in my title, it wouldn't have worked because in the link above is to "Option 2" with a capital letter."
