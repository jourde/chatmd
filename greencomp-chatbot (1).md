## What is GreenComp?

GreenComp is the European Sustainability Competence Framework developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre as part of the European Green Deal. It's a flexible, non-prescriptive reference tool designed to support lifelong learning about environmental sustainability.

**Why does it matter?**

GreenComp helps bridge the gap between knowing about sustainability issues and actually doing something about them. It empowers pupils to become systemic and critical thinkers who understand that humans are part of nature and can take meaningful action for a sustainable future.

**Key features:**

- **Universal application**: Suitable for all ages, education levels, and learning settings (formal, non-formal, and informal)
- **Interconnected approach**: The 12 competences work together as building blocks
- **Values-driven**: Promotes empathy, responsibility, and care for our planet
- **Action-orientated**: Moves beyond knowledge to develop practical skills and attitudes

## Key Principles for Success

As you work with GreenComp, keep these principles in mind:

### 1. Interconnectedness is Key

The 12 competences don't exist in isolation. A single activity often develops multiple competences simultaneously. For example, a school garden project might develop systems thinking (understanding ecosystems), collective action (working together), and promoting nature (connecting with the natural world).

### 2. Process Matters as Much as Content

How pupils learn about sustainability is as important as what they learn. Use participatory, experiential, and transformative pedagogies that mirror the collaborative, creative thinking needed for sustainability.

### 3. Context is Everything

GreenComp is intentionally flexible. Adapt it to your local context, your pupils' interests and experiences, and the unique sustainability challenges and opportunities in your community.

### 4. Start Where Your Pupils Are

Build on pupils' existing knowledge, experiences, and concerns. Use local examples and issues that matter to them as entry points for developing sustainability competences.

### 5. Embrace Uncertainty

Sustainability challenges are complex and don't have simple solutions. It's okay not to have all the answers. Model curiosity, adaptability, and learning alongside your pupils.

### 6. Action Brings Hope

Balance awareness of problems with opportunities for action. Pupils need to feel empowered, not overwhelmed. Celebrate progress and help them see their potential to make a difference.

### 7. Collaborate and Connect

Work with colleagues across subjects, connect with your local community, and tap into resources and expertise beyond your school. Sustainability education is enhanced through partnership.
