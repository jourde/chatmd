## What is GreenComp?

GreenComp is the European sustainability competence framework, developed by the European Commission to help educators teach sustainability in a structured, meaningful way.

Think of it as a compass for sustainability education. Rather than telling you exactly what to teach, it identifies **12 key competences** that help pupils develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to think, plan, and act sustainably.

**Key features of GreenComp:**

The framework is designed to be **flexible and non-prescriptive**. This means you can adapt it to your subject area, age group, and teaching context. It works across all curriculum areas and age groups from primary through secondary education.

GreenComp helps pupils become **systemic and critical thinkers** who understand that humans are part of nature and who can take meaningful action for sustainability.

The 12 competences are organised into 4 interconnected areas, and they're all equally important. Pupils don't need to master all 12 to the same level—the framework recognises that different learners will develop different strengths.

## Why does GreenComp matter for teachers?

Sustainability is increasingly recognised as an essential part of education, but many teachers feel uncertain about how to approach it. That's where GreenComp comes in.

**GreenComp helps you because it:**

**Provides clarity:** Instead of wondering what sustainability education means, you have a clear framework showing the key competences pupils should develop.

**Works across subjects:** Whether you teach science, geography, maths, languages, or arts, you can integrate sustainability competences into your existing curriculum. GreenComp isn't about adding extra content—it's about enriching what you already do.

**Supports progression:** The framework helps you understand how sustainability competences can develop from simple awareness in younger pupils to complex critical thinking and action in older ones.

**Empowers your pupils:** GreenComp isn't just about learning facts. It develops competences that enable pupils to become active agents of change who can address real sustainability challenges.

**Connects to wider goals:** GreenComp aligns with the European Green Deal and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, helping your pupils engage with pressing global issues.

Most importantly, you don't need to be a sustainability expert to use GreenComp. The framework is designed to support teachers at all levels of confidence and experience.

## The four competence areas

GreenComp organises its 12 competences into four interconnected areas. Each area contains three competences that work together.

These areas aren't meant to be taught separately or in a specific order. They overlap and reinforce each other, reflecting how sustainability itself is interconnected.

### The four areas are:

**1. Embodying sustainability values** helps pupils reflect on their personal values and develop respect for nature and fairness. This area includes valuing sustainability, supporting fairness, and promoting nature.

**2. Embracing complexity in sustainability** develops pupils' ability to think critically and understand how systems work. This area includes systems thinking, critical thinking, and problem framing.

**3. Envisioning sustainable futures** encourages pupils to imagine different possible futures and think creatively about solutions. This area includes futures literacy, adaptability, and exploratory thinking.

**4. Acting for sustainability** empowers pupils to take meaningful action, both individually and collectively. This area includes political agency, collective action, and individual initiative.

Together, these four areas provide a comprehensive approach to sustainability education that moves beyond knowledge to develop real-world competence.

## Embodying sustainability values

This competence area helps pupils develop a strong foundation of values that support sustainable behaviour. It's about understanding what we value and why, and connecting those values to how we treat our planet and each other.

### The three competences in this area:

**1. Valuing sustainability:** Pupils learn to reflect on their personal values and understand how values influence behaviour. They explore how different people and cultures may have different values, and they think critically about how their own values relate to sustainability.

**Classroom example:** Create a values discussion where pupils identify what matters most to them (e.g., fairness, beauty, health) and explore how these values connect to environmental and social issues.

**2. Supporting fairness:** This competence helps pupils understand justice, equality, and fairness in the context of sustainability. They recognise that environmental problems often affect different groups unequally, and they develop empathy and a sense of justice.

**Classroom example:** Examine case studies showing how climate change impacts different communities unequally, encouraging pupils to consider questions of environmental justice.

**3. Promoting nature:** Pupils develop an appreciation for nature and biodiversity, understanding that humans are part of the natural world, not separate from it. They learn to respect and value ecosystems and all living things.

**Classroom example:** Organise outdoor learning experiences where pupils observe and appreciate local nature, perhaps creating a school wildlife garden or conducting biodiversity surveys.

### Why this area matters:

Values drive behaviour. By helping pupils develop values that support sustainability, you're laying the foundation for lifelong sustainable thinking and action.

## Embracing complexity in sustainability

Sustainability challenges are complex—they involve interconnected systems, multiple perspectives, and no simple solutions. This competence area helps pupils develop the thinking skills needed to navigate this complexity.

### The three competences in this area:

**1. Systems thinking:** Pupils learn to see the bigger picture, understanding how different elements interact within and between systems. They consider time, space, and context when thinking about sustainability problems.

**Classroom example:** Use concept maps or system diagrams to show how food production connects to climate, water use, biodiversity, health, and the economy. Help pupils trace connections and identify feedback loops.

**2. Critical thinking:** This competence develops pupils' ability to assess information and arguments, identify assumptions, and challenge the status quo. They learn to reflect on how their own background influences their thinking.

**Classroom example:** Analyse sustainability claims in advertising or news articles. Ask pupils to identify evidence, spot biases, consider alternative viewpoints, and evaluate the credibility of sources.

**3. Problem framing:** Pupils learn to define sustainability problems clearly, considering who is involved, what time scales matter, and what the geographical scope is. This helps them understand problems before jumping to solutions.

**Classroom example:** Present a local environmental issue (e.g., litter, loss of green space) and guide pupils through framing the problem by asking: Who is affected? What are the root causes? What time frame are we considering? What different perspectives exist?

### Why this area matters:

Simple solutions often fail because they don't account for complexity. By developing these thinking competences, pupils become better equipped to understand and address real sustainability challenges.

## Envisioning sustainable futures

Change begins with imagination. This competence area helps pupils develop the creativity and flexibility needed to envision and work towards sustainable futures.

### The three competences in this area:

**1. Futures literacy:** Pupils develop the ability to imagine alternative futures and scenarios. They learn to think beyond "business as usual" and explore what different sustainable futures might look like, including the steps needed to achieve them.

**Classroom example:** Run a "futures workshop" where pupils create scenarios for their community in 2050. What would a sustainable version look like? What would need to change to get there?

**2. Adaptability:** This competence helps pupils manage change, uncertainty, and ambiguity. They learn to be flexible and resilient when facing sustainability challenges, making decisions even when outcomes are uncertain.

**Classroom example:** Use role-play scenarios where pupils must adapt to changing conditions (e.g., a community responding to climate impacts). Discuss how people and systems can build resilience and respond to unexpected challenges.

**3. Exploratory thinking:** Pupils learn to think creatively, make connections across disciplines, and experiment with new ideas. They become comfortable with exploring multiple possibilities and learning through trial and error.

**Classroom example:** Set design challenges that require creative solutions to sustainability problems (e.g., design a zero-waste school lunch system). Encourage experimentation, prototyping, and learning from failures.

### Why this area matters:

The future is not predetermined. By developing these competences, pupils learn they can actively shape a more sustainable future rather than passively accepting current trends.

## Acting for sustainability

Understanding sustainability isn't enough—pupils also need the competence to take meaningful action. This area empowers them to become agents of change.

### The three competences in this area:

**1. Political agency:** Pupils learn to understand and navigate political systems. They develop the ability to identify who is responsible for sustainability issues and to advocate for effective policies. This isn't about party politics—it's about understanding how decisions are made and how citizens can influence them.

**Classroom example:** Map out decision-making in your school or community regarding an environmental issue. Who has the power to make changes? How can pupils make their voices heard? Perhaps write to decision-makers about a sustainability concern.

**2. Collective action:** This competence helps pupils learn to work collaboratively with others to create change. They understand that many sustainability challenges require group effort and that working together is often more effective than working alone.

**Classroom example:** Organise a school or community sustainability project that requires teamwork—perhaps a recycling programme, energy-saving campaign, or community garden. Help pupils experience the power of collective action.

**3. Individual initiative:** Pupils develop the confidence and capability to take personal action aligned with their sustainability values. They learn to translate their knowledge and values into concrete behaviours in their daily lives.

**Classroom example:** Support pupils in identifying and committing to personal sustainability actions. This might include reducing waste, changing transport choices, or influencing their family's purchasing decisions. Help them track their impact and reflect on their experiences.

### Why this area matters:

Knowledge without action leads to helplessness. By developing these competences, pupils gain agency and empowerment. They learn they can make a difference, both individually and collectively.

## How can I use GreenComp in my classroom?

The beauty of GreenComp is its flexibility—there's no single "right" way to use it. Here are some practical approaches:

### Integration, not addition

You don't need to create entirely new lessons. Instead, look for opportunities to develop sustainability competences within your existing curriculum. For example, a geography lesson on climate could develop systems thinking, whilst a literature discussion could explore values and fairness.

### Start where you are

You don't need to address all 12 competences at once. Choose one or two that feel most relevant to your current teaching and build from there. Perhaps you're already doing activities that develop certain competences without realising it.

### Cross-curricular connections

Sustainability naturally crosses subject boundaries. Consider collaborating with colleagues to create projects that draw on multiple subjects whilst developing several GreenComp competences.

### Mix knowledge, skills, and attitudes

Remember that competences include knowledge, skills, and attitudes. A complete approach involves helping pupils understand sustainability (knowledge), develop practical abilities like critical thinking (skills), and cultivate values and motivation (attitudes).

### Connect to real contexts

Pupils engage more deeply when learning connects to their lives and communities. Use local examples, invite pupils to investigate real issues, and create opportunities for authentic action.

### Progressive development

Think about how competences can develop over time. Younger pupils might start with awareness and simple actions, whilst older pupils can engage with more complex systems thinking and sustained projects.

### Reflect and discuss

Build in time for pupils to reflect on their learning and discuss their developing understanding. Sustainability competences deepen through reflection and dialogue.

## Getting started with small steps

Feeling ready to begin? Here are some practical first steps:

### Step 1: Reflect on current practice

Look at what you're already doing. You might be surprised to find you're already developing some GreenComp competences. This recognition can build your confidence and show you where to expand.

### Step 2: Choose one competence area

Select one of the four competence areas that resonates with you or fits naturally with your upcoming teaching. You don't need to master everything at once.

### Step 3: Try one small activity

Implement one simple activity that develops competences in your chosen area. For example, if you've chosen "Embracing complexity," try a systems thinking activity using a topic you're already teaching.

### Step 4: Connect with pupils' interests

Ask your pupils what sustainability issues they care about. Their genuine interests will provide motivation and relevance for developing competences.

### Step 5: Collaborate and share

Talk to colleagues about sustainability education. Share ideas, team up for projects, or simply discuss how GreenComp might enhance your teaching. You don't have to do this alone.

### Step 6: Build gradually

Once you've tried something and reflected on it, add another element. Perhaps address another competence area, deepen your work in the first area, or extend an activity into a larger project.

### Step 7: Join the community

Consider connecting with other educators using GreenComp. The European Commission has created a GreenComp community of practice where teachers share experiences and resources.

### Remember:

You're not expected to be perfect or to transform your entire practice overnight. Every small step towards developing sustainability competences in your pupils is valuable. Start small, learn as you go, and build your confidence over time.
