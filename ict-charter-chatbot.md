- Tell a teacher straight away if you think someone knows your password

**DON'T:**
- Share your password with friends
- Use someone else's account
- Write your password where others can see it

When you use technology at school, you should be just as kind as you are in person!

**Always remember to:**
- Be polite in emails and messages
- Never send mean messages or pictures
- Never share photos or videos of other people without asking
- Stand up for others if you see unkind behaviour online
- Keep other people's information private

**Never do this:**
- Send hurtful or mean messages (cyberbullying)
- Share embarrassing photos or videos of others
- Pretend to be someone else
- Say unkind things about teachers or classmates

If someone is being unkind to you online, tell a trusted adult straight away. You're not alone, and they can help!

**Staying Safe on the Internet üåê**

The internet is amazing for learning, but you need to follow important safety rules:

**Do:**
- Only visit websites your teacher says are okay
- Use the internet for schoolwork and learning
- Ask a teacher before downloading anything
- Close any pop-ups or strange messages

**Don't:**
- Share your full name, address, phone number or school name online
- Join chat rooms or social media at school
- Click on links in emails from people you don't know
- Create accounts using your school email without permission

**Special note about AI:** You can only use AI tools (like ChatGPT) if your teacher says it's okay. If you use AI for homework at home, you must tell your teacher!

## Consequences

**What Happens If I Break the Rules? ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The school rules are there to keep everyone safe and happy. If you break them, there will be consequences.

**Possible consequences might include:**
- A warning from your teacher
- Losing permission to use school technology for a while
- Your parents being contacted
- Following the school's behaviour rules
- If you damage equipment deliberately, your parents might have to pay for repairs

**But remember:**
- Making an honest mistake is different from breaking rules on purpose
- If you tell the truth and ask for help, that shows responsibility
- Everyone makes mistakes - the important thing is learning from them

The best approach? Follow the rules, be kind online, and ask for help when you're not sure!
