I need you to create an interactive chatbot in Markdown format on the topic:

**Your task:**
1. Analyse the example file to understand the chatbot format and syntax: https://github.com/jourde/chatmd/blob/main/syntax_example.md
2. Structure the content into an engaging, navigable chatbot.
3. Create the chatbot and save it as a .md file.

**Requirements:**
- Include YAML frontmatter (clavier: true, gestionGrosMots: true, rechercheContenu: false)
- Write an engaging initial message that introduces the topic and guides users with navigation options
- Create level 2 sections (##) covering the main themes from the content
- Each section should include:
  - A list of trigger keywords/phrases (in a bullet list at the top)
  - Clear, accessible explanations
  - Navigation links at the end connecting to related sections
- Use descriptive link text for buttons: [Button text](Section heading)
- Include an option to return to the start where appropriate: [Back to start]()
- Ensure logical flow between sections so users can explore topics in different orders

**Tone:** Informative, accessible, and encouraging exploration
