## Understanding GreenComp

Excellent choice! Let's explore what GreenComp is all about.

GreenComp, or the European Sustainability Competence Framework, is a comprehensive tool developed by the European Commission to help pupils develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to address sustainability challenges.

**Think of GreenComp as your roadmap for sustainability education.** It identifies 12 key competences organised around four interconnected areas:

**Embodying sustainability values** – This area focuses on helping pupils appreciate the importance of sustainability, understand our relationship with nature, and think about the future in constructive ways. It includes competences like valuing sustainability, supporting fairness, and promoting nature.

**Embracing complexity in sustainability** – Here, pupils learn to see connections between systems, think critically about information, and explore different futures. This develops their systems thinking, critical thinking, and ability to imagine alternative scenarios.

**Envisioning sustainable futures** – This area encourages pupils to be adaptable, explore possibilities, and think innovatively about sustainability challenges. It nurtures their adaptability, exploratory thinking, and political agency.

**Acting for sustainability** – The final area is about taking action – working together, planning for change, and participating actively in creating a sustainable future. This includes political agency, collective action, and individual initiative.

**Why does this matter for you as a teacher?**

GreenComp provides a common language and structure for sustainability education across Europe. It helps you identify learning outcomes, design meaningful activities, and assess your pupils' progress in developing sustainability competences. Most importantly, it's flexible enough to be integrated into any subject area – from science and geography to art, maths, and languages.

## Implementing GreenComp

Fantastic! Let's look at practical ways to bring GreenComp into your teaching practice.

**Starting small is perfectly fine** – you don't need to overhaul your entire curriculum. Begin by identifying which GreenComp competences naturally connect with your existing lessons. For example, if you're teaching about local history, you could explore how communities have adapted to environmental changes (linking to adaptability and systems thinking).

**Here are some practical approaches for beginner teachers:**

**Connect to pupils' lived experiences** – Sustainability becomes meaningful when pupils see its relevance to their own lives. Ask them to investigate sustainability issues in their community, analyse their own consumption patterns, or interview family members about environmental changes they've witnessed. This approach naturally develops critical thinking and political agency.

**Use cross-curricular projects** – Sustainability challenges are inherently interdisciplinary, making them perfect for collaborative projects. You might work with colleagues to create a project where pupils use maths to analyse energy consumption, science to understand climate systems, English to communicate findings, and art to create awareness campaigns. This helps pupils develop systems thinking and collective action skills.

**Encourage action-oriented learning** – GreenComp emphasises moving beyond awareness to action. Create opportunities for pupils to make real changes – whether it's establishing a school garden, conducting an energy audit, organising a repair café, or creating a sustainable transport plan for your school. These experiences build pupils' sense of agency and demonstrate that their actions matter.

**Foster futures thinking** – Help pupils imagine positive sustainable futures rather than dwelling only on problems. Use activities like "design a sustainable school/community/city of the future" or "write a letter from 2050 describing how we solved the climate crisis". This develops their ability to envision alternatives and maintain hope.

**Integrate reflection and dialogue** – Regular discussions about values, trade-offs, and different perspectives are crucial. Create safe spaces where pupils can explore complex questions like "What does fairness mean in sustainability?" or "How do we balance individual freedom with collective responsibility?" This nurtures their appreciation of complexity and ability to embrace different viewpoints.

**Assessment approaches** – Move beyond traditional tests to include portfolios, self-assessment, peer feedback, and reflective journals. Look for evidence of pupils applying sustainability thinking in new contexts, asking more sophisticated questions, or taking initiative on sustainability issues.

**Remember**: You're not expected to be a sustainability expert. Learning alongside your pupils, acknowledging uncertainty, and modelling curiosity and adaptability are all valuable parts of sustainability education. Your enthusiasm and willingness to explore these important questions matter more than having all the answers.
