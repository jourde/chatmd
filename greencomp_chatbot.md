# GreenComp: Your Guide to Sustainability Education

Welcome! This chatbot will help you discover GreenComp, the European Sustainability Competence Framework. Whether you're completely new to sustainability education or looking to refresh your understanding, you're in the right place.

GreenComp provides a common language and structure for teaching sustainability across all subjects and year groups. It identifies 12 key competences organised into four interconnected areas, helping your pupils develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes they need to think, plan, and act sustainably.

## What is GreenComp

GreenComp is the European Sustainability Competence Framework, developed as part of the European Green Deal. Think of it as a roadmap that helps educators like you integrate sustainability into teaching and learning.

**Why does it matter?**

Sustainability isn't just about recycling or climate science—it's about helping pupils understand the interconnected nature of our world and empowering them to make positive changes. GreenComp provides a shared framework that bridges the gap between knowledge and action.

**Key features:**

GreenComp identifies 12 sustainability competences grouped into four interrelated areas. It's designed to be flexible and adaptable—not a rigid prescription, but a supportive guide you can use across any subject, age group, or learning context. The framework emphasises that sustainability competences develop together, often overlapping and reinforcing one another.

**Who is it for?**

Everyone involved in lifelong learning! Whether you teach primary pupils or work with secondary learners, GreenComp can be woven into your existing curriculum. It builds on other European frameworks you might already know, such as DigComp (digital competence) and EntreComp (entrepreneurship).

The beauty of GreenComp is that it doesn't require you to become a sustainability expert overnight. Instead, it offers a common language and structure to gradually embed sustainability thinking into what you're already teaching.

## The Four Areas

- embodying values
- thinking critically
- imagining futures
- taking action

GreenComp organises its 12 competences into four interconnected areas. These aren't separate boxes to tick—they work together, creating a holistic approach to sustainability education. Let's explore each area:

**1. Embodying sustainability values**

This area focuses on helping pupils reflect on their personal values and understand how values shape our relationship with the planet. It includes three competences: valuing sustainability, supporting fairness, and promoting nature. Pupils learn to appreciate diverse perspectives and develop empathy for people, other species, and future generations.

**2. Embracing complexity in sustainability**

Sustainability challenges are rarely simple! This area develops pupils' ability to understand interconnected systems and think critically. It includes systems thinking, critical thinking, and problem framing. Pupils learn to see how environmental, social, and economic issues are linked, question assumptions, and identify the real problems beneath surface symptoms.

**3. Envisioning sustainable futures**

What kind of future do we want? This area encourages imagination and forward thinking through futures literacy, adaptability, and exploratory thinking. Pupils develop the ability to envision alternative scenarios, manage uncertainty, and experiment creatively with new ideas—essential skills for addressing complex sustainability challenges.

**4. Acting for sustainability**

Knowledge without action isn't enough. This final area empowers pupils to become active citizens through political agency, collective action, and individual initiative. Pupils learn to navigate systems, collaborate with others, and take personal responsibility for creating positive change in their communities and beyond.

**The interconnected nature**

Remember, these four areas constantly interact. For example, understanding systems (Area 2) helps pupils take more effective action (Area 4), while embodying values (Area 1) shapes how they envision the future (Area 3). This holistic approach reflects the interconnected nature of sustainability itself.

## Classroom Practice

- integrate across subjects
- use real-world projects
- encourage pupil agency
- collaborate with others

Ready to bring GreenComp into your teaching? The good news is you don't need to overhaul your entire curriculum. GreenComp is designed to enhance what you're already doing. Here are some practical approaches:

**Start where you are**

Look at your existing lessons and identify natural connections to sustainability. Teaching about water in science? Connect it to water conservation and global water access (supporting fairness). Studying local history? Explore how communities have adapted to environmental changes over time (adaptability). The framework fits around your curriculum, not the other way around.

**Use interdisciplinary approaches**

Sustainability is inherently cross-curricular. Consider collaborating with colleagues to design projects that span multiple subjects. A project on school food, for example, could involve science (nutrition, food production), geography (food miles, climate impact), maths (calculating carbon footprints), and citizenship (fair trade, food justice).

**Embrace active and pupil-centred learning**

GreenComp competences develop best through doing, not just listening. Project-based learning, real-world problem-solving, and community partnerships help pupils move from knowledge to action. Give pupils agency: let them identify problems in their school or community, research solutions, and implement changes. This builds critical thinking, collective action, and individual initiative simultaneously.

**Think small to start**

You don't need to tackle everything at once. Start with one or two competences that align with your current teaching. Perhaps begin with systems thinking by using concept maps to show connections, or explore futures literacy through "what if" scenarios. As you grow more confident, you'll naturally integrate more competences.

**Connect to pupils' lives and interests**

Make sustainability relevant by linking it to what matters to your pupils. Urban biodiversity, fast fashion, social media's environmental impact, local community projects—find entry points that spark curiosity and demonstrate that sustainability isn't abstract or distant.

**Foster reflection**

Build in time for pupils to reflect on their learning, values, and actions. Reflection helps them recognise their developing competences and see themselves as agents of change. Simple reflection prompts can make a big difference.

Remember, you're not expected to be perfect. GreenComp is a journey, and every small step you take helps prepare pupils for a sustainable future.
