## What is GreenComp
- sustainability framework
- European framework
- competence framework

**GreenComp** is the European Sustainability Competence Framework (2022). It identifies key competences pupils need to become sustainability-minded citizens.

**Why it matters:** GreenComp provides a clear structure for embedding sustainability across any subject and age group. It's about helping pupils develop critical thinking, empathy, and agency—not adding extra content.

**Structure:** 4 areas containing 12 competences, with learning outcomes and practical examples.

**4. Acting for sustainability** - Taking individual and collective action, working for change.

Each area contains 3 competences (12 total).

- implement
- teaching
- classroom

**How to use GreenComp in your teaching:**

**1. Start small** - Choose one or two competences that fit your current teaching.

**2. Use learning outcomes** - Each competence has outcomes at three levels to guide lesson objectives.

**3. Integrate across subjects** - History, maths, art, and PE can all develop GreenComp competences.

**4. Focus on progression** - Move pupils from foundational (understanding) to intermediate (applying) to advanced (initiating change).

**5. Encourage pupil agency** - Give pupils opportunities to make decisions and take initiative.

You don't need to teach all 12 at once. Build gradually.

**Quick classroom examples:**

**Systems thinking** - Pupils map a smartphone's journey from raw materials to disposal, exploring environmental and social impacts.

**Futures literacy** - Pupils create visual representations of their school in 2050, imagining sustainable scenarios.

**Collective action** - Pupils identify a school sustainability issue and work in teams to propose solutions.

**Supporting fairness** - Pupils compare carbon emissions and climate impacts across countries, debating ethical responsibilities.

**Critical thinking** - Pupils analyse 'green' product advertisements, identifying greenwashing.

**Tip:** Connect to pupils' lived experiences and make learning visible by naming the competence being developed.
