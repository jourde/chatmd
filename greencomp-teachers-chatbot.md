## What is GreenComp?

GreenComp is a reference framework for sustainability competences developed by the European Commission in 2022. Think of it as your roadmap for helping pupils develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to live, work, and act sustainably.

**Key features:**
- **12 interconnected competences** organised into 4 areas
- Applicable to **all ages and education levels**
- Designed for lifelong learning
- Flexible and adaptable to any learning context

The framework defines sustainability as "prioritising the needs of all life forms, ensuring that human activities do not exceed the limits of the planet's resources."

**What makes it special?**
GreenComp doesn't just focus on environmental knowledge ‚Äì it develops critical thinking, empathy, and agency. It empowers pupils to become active participants in creating sustainable futures, not just passive learners.

## Why Teachers Matter

As a teacher, you're uniquely positioned to shape the next generation's understanding of sustainability. Here's why GreenComp is essential for your practice:

**The Challenge:**
41% of young people in Europe believe their schooling doesn't adequately prepare them to understand climate change or act sustainably. There's a clear gap between knowledge and action that education must bridge.

**Your Role:**
You can help pupils develop:
- **Systems thinking** ‚Äì understanding how everything connects
- **Critical thinking** ‚Äì questioning the status quo
- **Agency** ‚Äì believing they can make a difference
- **Values** ‚Äì appreciating nature and fairness

**The Impact:**
Using GreenComp, you're not just teaching about the environment ‚Äì you're:
- Developing future-ready skills
- Fostering empathy and responsibility
- Encouraging active citizenship
- Building resilience and hope

**It's not prescriptive:**
GreenComp isn't a rigid curriculum you must follow. Instead, it's a flexible reference that adapts to your teaching style, subject area, and pupils' needs.

## The Four Areas

GreenComp organises sustainability learning into **four interconnected competence areas**. Think of them as four pillars that support each other ‚Äì none works in isolation.

### üåø Area 1: Embodying Sustainability Values
**What it means:** Developing a personal connection to sustainability through values, fairness, and nature appreciation.

**The three competences:**
1. **Valuing sustainability** ‚Äì understanding why sustainability matters
2. **Supporting fairness** ‚Äì promoting justice and equity
3. **Promoting nature** ‚Äì appreciating and protecting biodiversity

---

### üß© Area 2: Embracing Complexity in Sustainability
**What it means:** Understanding that sustainability challenges are complex, interconnected, and require careful thinking.

**The three competences:**
1. **Systems thinking** ‚Äì seeing connections and relationships
2. **Critical thinking** ‚Äì questioning assumptions and evidence
3. **Problem framing** ‚Äì identifying and articulating challenges

---

### ‚ú® Area 3: Envisioning Sustainable Futures
**What it means:** Imagining and planning for better, more sustainable futures.

**The three competences:**
1. **Futures literacy** ‚Äì exploring different scenarios
2. **Adaptability** ‚Äì responding flexibly to change
3. **Exploratory thinking** ‚Äì trying new approaches

---

### üé¨ Area 4: Acting for Sustainability
**What it means:** Taking concrete action and inspiring others to join the sustainability journey.

**The three competences:**
1. **Political agency** ‚Äì engaging in collective action
2. **Collective action** ‚Äì working together for change
3. **Individual initiative** ‚Äì taking personal responsibility

---

**The Bee Pollination Metaphor:**
GreenComp uses bee pollination to illustrate interconnection. Bees (acting), flowers (envisioning), beehives (values), and pollen (complexity) all depend on each other for the ecosystem to thrive.

## Teaching Approaches

Developing sustainability competences requires a shift from traditional teaching methods. Here's how to approach it effectively:

### üîÑ Transformative Education
Move beyond knowledge transfer to **transforming perspectives and behaviours**. Encourage pupils to:
- Reflect on their beliefs and assumptions
- Question their role in society
- Connect learning to real-life situations
- Take meaningful action

### üåê Holistic Approach
Sustainability isn't just a science topic. Integrate it across:
- **All subjects** ‚Äì maths, languages, arts, humanities
- **School culture** ‚Äì policies, facilities, partnerships
- **Community connections** ‚Äì local projects and experts
- **Pupil voice** ‚Äì give them genuine input and leadership

### üí° Key Principles

**1. Make it relevant**
Connect sustainability to pupils' lives, interests, and local context. Use examples they can see and experience.

**2. Foster active learning**
Move beyond lectures. Use:
- Project-based learning
- Outdoor education
- Community partnerships
- Peer teaching
- Real-world problem-solving

**3. Develop critical thinking**
Don't present sustainability as simple or one-dimensional. Encourage pupils to:
- Explore tensions and trade-offs
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Question "green" marketing claims
- Think systemically

**4. Build agency and hope**
Avoid overwhelming pupils with doom and gloom. Instead:
- Celebrate positive examples
- Provide opportunities for action

## Common Questions

Let me address some questions beginner teachers often have about GreenComp:

### ‚ùì Is this just environmental education?

No! While environmental issues are central, GreenComp addresses social, economic, and cultural dimensions too. It's about holistic sustainability ‚Äì how we live together on this planet.

### ‚ùì Do I need to be a sustainability expert?

Absolutely not! You're learning alongside your pupils. Your willingness to explore, ask questions, and take action matters more than having all the answers.

### ‚ùì How is this different from what I'm already doing?

GreenComp provides structure and language for sustainability education. You're probably already addressing some competences ‚Äì this framework helps you be more intentional and comprehensive.

### ‚ùì Will this add to my workload?

Initially, yes ‚Äì like any new approach. But GreenComp integrates into existing curriculum, and over time, it becomes a natural lens for planning, not an add-on.

### ‚ùì What if my school isn't prioritising sustainability?

Start small! Individual teachers can make a difference. Share successes with colleagues, invite leadership to pupil presentations, build momentum gradually.

### ‚ùì How do I handle climate anxiety in pupils?

Balance honesty about challenges with hope and agency. Focus on solutions, celebrate positive action, provide outlets for feelings, and connect pupils with supportive communities.

### ‚ùì Can I use GreenComp in any subject?

Yes! Every subject offers opportunities. Maths analyses data, languages develop communication, arts express connections, sciences investigate systems, humanities explore justice.

### ‚ùì What if pupils disagree on sustainability issues?

Excellent! Sustainability involves legitimate tensions. Create safe spaces for respectful debate, teach critical thinking, acknowledge complexity, and focus on shared values.

### ‚ùì Do I need special resources or facilities?

Not necessarily. Many activities use everyday materials or focus on thinking and discussion. Your local community is a rich learning resource too.

### ‚ùì How long does it take to develop these competences?

It's a lifelong journey! Competences develop gradually. Some aspects emerge quickly, others deepen over years. Every step matters.
