- what we do

The European Schools' system provides **high-quality, multilingual, multicultural, and inclusive education** for pupils from nursery until the end of secondary cycle.

Rooted in European and democratic values, the system fosters citizenship, intercultural understanding and cooperation. This equips pupils with the competencies necessary to thrive academically, socially and personally in a diverse and rapidly changing globalised world.

**The founding vision** comes from Marcel Decombis, who beautifully expressed the essential aim: pupils educated side by side, untroubled by divisive prejudices, will mature into Europeans who look to their own lands with love and pride whilst belonging together.

**Language provision:** Education is offered in all official languages of the EU, from nursery to upper-secondary, culminating in the European Baccalaureate.

**How multiculturalism works in practice:**
- Pupils from different language sections study some subjects in mixed language groups
- Teachers across EU Member States collaborate in teaching, sharing and exchanging best practice
- Inspectors from all EU Member States collaborate and provide professional advice on pedagogical developments

The multicultural education is delivered through the curriculum itself, creating daily opportunities for pupils to interact across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

**Active participation** of all stakeholders—pupils, parents, educators and administrative staff—is promoted in decision-making processes.
